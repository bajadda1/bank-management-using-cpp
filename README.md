# Bank Management System using OOP in C++

---

## Introduction

Welcome to our Bank Management System implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project provides a simple yet effective way to manage bank accounts, perform transactions, and calculate interest rates.

## Features

- **Account Creation**: Allows users to create new bank accounts with their personal information and an initial deposit.
- **Deposit**: Enables users to deposit money into their accounts securely.
- **Withdrawal**: Allows users to withdraw funds from their accounts, with appropriate error handling for insufficient balance.
- **Interest Calculation**: Calculates compound interest on account balances over a specified number of years.
- **Data Persistence**: Saves account information to a text file for future reference.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Code**: Compile the source code using a C++ compiler. You may use a command-line compiler or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code or Code::Blocks.

2. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled executable to launch the Bank Management System.

3. **Navigate the Menu**: Use the menu options to perform various operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, interest calculations, and exiting the program.

4. **Follow On-Screen Prompts**: The program will provide prompts and instructions to guide you through each operation. Follow these prompts to input necessary information and perform transactions.

## Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can use GCC, Clang, or any other compliant compiler.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
